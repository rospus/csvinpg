**Bash Script for Mirroring, Validating, and Importing Remote CSV Files**

This Bash script automates the process of mirroring a remote directory (via SFTP), validating and repairing any downloaded CSV files, and then importing them into a PostgreSQL database. This is particularly useful for scenarios involving large-scale postal printing.

The script is well-documented, making it easy to understand its functionality and customize it for specific needs.
